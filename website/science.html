    <br> This page serves as a brief introduction to the science background for the base science case for CHART. There are many potential radio
     projects one could do with the simple instrument we describe in the tutorials, but we will describe a basic "Milky Way Measurement" lab here.
    <br> <b>The Milky Way</b>
    <br>- These tutorials will walk the user through making measurements of the motion of the Milky Way. Most users are likely familiar with the 
     basic optical view of our own galaxy- however, many may never have seen the Milky Way outside of photographs. Optical observations are best done 
     under clear skies from dark rural locations, and most people live in cities where air quality can be low or clouds are common. About 80% of North
     Americans cannot see the Milky Way from their homes (cite). However, radio frequency observations can be done from cities, and can be performed during 
     the day time. Additionally, radio frequency observations can illuminate different properties of astronomical objects that cannot 
     be observed with low-cost optical instruments, such as Doppler shift from motion and spectral properties of galaxies. Our galaxy is a "barred 
     spiral galaxy", meaning the matter in the galaxy is structured in a central bar-shape with spiral arms. With radio observations, we can map the 
     rotation of these spiral arms, gaining insight into the way our galaxy moves. We can use this information to reconstruct the "rotation curve" of 
     the Milky Way, which shows the velocity of the matter as a function of distance from the center of the galaxy. 
    <br>
    <br> <b>The 21-cm Line</b>
     <br>- When viewing the Milky Way at optical wavelengths, either with the naked eye, a telescope, or a camera, we are detecting emission from luminous
     sources in the galaxy, such as stars. However, material in the Milky Way emits at different wavelengths depending on it's composition. The easiest emission
     to detect in Radio Frequency comes from clouds of neutral gas that reside in the spiral arms of the galaxy. These clouds are made of neutral hydrogen, 
     which has one proton and one electron. This proton and electron each have a quantum mechanical property called a "spin", and the spins can be aligned with 
     one another or anti-aligned. The anti-aligned state will be slightly lower in energy than the aligned state, and we known from the laws of physics that 
     lower energy states are preferred. This means that if an atom of neutral hydrogen is excited into the aligned state by some incoming energy, after some 
     time there is a probability that the atom will spontaneously revert to the anti-aligned state, emitting the extra energy as a photon with a wavelength of 
     21-cm, or a frequency of 1420.4 MHz. This transition has a relatively low probability of occuring, but as Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the 
     universe, any part of the galaxy with neutral Hydrogen is emitting many of these photos at any given time. Due to it's characteristic frequency of 1420.4 MHz, 
     we can detect this emission with a radio telescope, and investigate the resulting spectrum for information about the Hydrogen clouds.
