        Why Radio Astronomy?

  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p style="margin:20px;"> Our experinces are based off of the sensory inputs that our bodies provide.
    Until recently, we have only been able to see the visible spectrum of the more broad electromagnetic spectrum.
  <br><img src="images_for_website/emspectrum.jpg"class="left" alt="E&M Spectrum" style="width:1000px; height:400px;border-radius:5px;">
  <p><span class="boldtext">Electromagnetic Spectrum (credit NASA)</span><br>
  <br>  With advances in tehnology, we have been able to observe the whole electromagnetic spectrum which has allowed
    the field of astronomy to discover many parts of our universe that we were blind to before.
    Radio waves have frequencies from 300GHz to 3kHz, and are the lowest frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.
    These frequencies have proved to hold many gems in discovering what our universe really consists of.
    Some of these discoveries due to radio astronomy have been: the existance of the cosmic microwave background, pulsars, quasars, and radio galaxies.
    This is only a short introduction to the field of radio astronomy; If you would like to learn more about the field as a whole,
    please visit the links below for deeper insight into radio astronomy.

  <h2>Why We Created This Project</h2>
  <p style="margin:20px;">We believe in the importance of making astronomy accessible to anyone that is interested; that the ability to discover more about our home, the universe, is a right and not a luxury; and that creating collaborative projects with diversity as a priority allows for greater advances in the field of science. The convergence of these ideas come together in the CHART project. Accessibility in our project is defined as affordability and ease in navigation. The CHART project guides novices and hobbyist alike in building their own radio telescope and taking data directly from the skies above at a price around $100. We have chosen every material used in this project carefully to insure low cost to the user and ease in locating that part over time. We have created step-by-step tutorials to build an optimized telescope and set up its hardware, so that the participants feel guided in completion of the project, rather than intimidated and discouraged. All of our code for this project is open source so that anyone can access and modify it for their personal subprojects and collaborative endeavors. Our main mission for this project is to empower participants from anywhere in the world to gain experience in the field of astronomy and increase diversity and participation in STEM.
