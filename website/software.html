<p>Before starting this tutorial, it’s highly recommended to go through the <a href="#Vocabulary">Software Vocabulary</a> section to get familiar with the concepts explained in the following tutorial.</p>
<hr class="thinline">
</div>
<div>
  <a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Introduction</h2>
Most of us familiar with using a Mac or PC computer and are comfortable with this kind of set up. This project’s set up is going to be different than these systems, but not difficult to navigate after spending some time getting familiar with all of the components. For this project, we will be using a Raspberry Pi as our computing device. This type of computing device doesn’t store data locally, so we will need to use an SD card for storage. Since we will be starting with a computing device that doesn’t have a preinstalled OS or GUI, we will need to set these up so that we can interact with the computer with ease. We chose Raspberry Pi OS, which is a version of Linux built to run on the Pi.

  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Raspberry Pi Set Up</h2>
	<p>To get started, we need to make sure that all our wires are hooked up and ready to go.</p>
	<li>Hook up your Raspberry Pi to your monitor.</li>
	<li>Plug in your ethernet cable.</li>
	<li>Hook up to your keyboard (we used a wireless hook up for ours).</li>	
	<li>Plug in your Raspberry Pi into a power source.</li>

  <img src="https://astrochart.github.io/website/tutorials/rasp_set_up.jpeg" class="left" alt="raspberry pi set up" style="width:400px;border-radius:5px;">
<br><span class="boldfont"> This is what the Pi should look like. (You can choose which USB ports you want to use)</span><br>
	<br>
<p>Make sure all connections we set up in the beginning of the tutorial are still in place so that our system will start up on the monitor screen.
The system will now prompt you to choose your location settings, and to set a <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. Once this set up process is complete, it will check for updates.</p>

  <a class="anchor" id="command"></a>
  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Introduction to Command Line Terminal</h2>
  <h4 style="text-align:left;">What is command line?</h4>
<p><span class="boldfont">Command line or “Command Line User Interface”</span>: is a way of communicating with
your computer through typed commands; this is usually done through the computer’s terminal.</p>
<p><img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/Terminal.png" width="80" height="" alt="65"/></p>
<br>
 <img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/1.png" class="left" alt="Image of the Command Line" style="height:150px;border-radius:5px;">
 <p>Our computers are usually run through a GUI (graphical user interface), and
	  so we are used to a different way of navigating through our systems.</p>

<p>  <span class="underline">For example:</span> If you are on your desktop and
  want to go into your documents folder on your desktop, you will
  click on that folder and it will open up to display the contents in your documents folder.
This function is run through a GUI.</p>

<p>  In command line, we don’t have a GUI that makes it so that we can double click
  into a location, instead we will need to type in our commands into our terminal.</p>

<p><b>Tip: </b>Linux uses case sensitive code so that means that we need to be very careful about lower-case and upper-case letter. From now on, it’s a good rule of thumb to use all lower case letters so we don’t run into mistakes like this.</p>

 <p>Another note about Linux is that putting spaces when naming a file/document can cause you trouble later on. Instead of using a space, use “_” an underscore like I did in these files.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:left;">Exercise:</h5>
  <p>For this exercise we are going to be using the command line in our Raspberry Pi  This example is specific to the Linux operating system.
	You can click on the Terminal Icon at the top of your screen or access your terminal through the command <b>Ctrl + Alt + T </b></p>

	<h5>1. Create a folder on your desktop that is called “example”</h5>
	<li>To do this, right click on your desktop and select <b>"New Folder..."</b>. </li>
	  <br>
	<h5>2. Inside of the “example” folder, create another folder called “example_2”</h5>
	<li>To do this, double click on the example folder on your desktop and click the <b>folder icon</b> second from the left.</li>
	<img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/FolderIcon.png" width="70" height="60" alt=""/><br>
	  <br>
	<h5>3. Inside of the “example_2” folder create an empty file document called “example_3”</h5>
	<li>To do this, click on the example_2 folder you just created and right click in the open space on the right of the window. Click <b>"New File..."</b>.</li>
	  <br>
  <h5>4. Now that we have our set up ready, lets navigate using our terminal and directories.</h5>
	

	<li>Type: <i><b>ls</b></i> and hit enter (<i>l</i> = L)</li>

  <span class="boldfont">ls</span> stands for ‘list directory’ This will show you what contents are in the directory you are currently in on your Pi. Here you can see the other directories/folders in your computer. If you type this while in a directory, it will show the contents in just that directory. 

<br>
	<img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/2.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:220px;border-radius:5px;">
	<p></p>
<br>

<h5>5. We have saved files on the desktop, so we will navigate there.</h5>
	<span class="commandline">cd</span> stands for ‘change directory’ and it allows the user to navigate to a different location on the computer
	<li>You can change your directory by typing <span class="commandline">cd Desktop</span> and click enter. This places you in the Desktop directory. </li>
	  <li>Now type <span class="commandline">ls</span> and click enter to make sure you are in the location where your files are.</li> 
<p>You can navigate to a  different location on my computer by typing <span class="commandline">cd [desired location]</span> and clicking enter</p>

 <br>
 <img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/3.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:220px;border-radius:5px;">
	<p></p>
<br>
  <h5>6. I can see the ‘example’ folder on my desktop so let’s change our directory again into this folder.</h5>
	<li> Type: <span class="commandline">cd example</span> and click enter as shown above.</li>
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline"> ls </span> and click enter</li>

<br>
	<img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/4.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:230px;border-radius:5px;">
<p><span class="boldfont">We can see that our other folder “example_2” is inside of this folder where we placed it earlier.</span></p>

  <h5>7. Let’s go inside of the example_2 folder</h5>
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">cd example_2</span> and click enter</li>

 <br><img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/5.png" class="left" alt="Image of Command Line" style="height:260px;border-radius:5px;"/>
<p></p>
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">ls</span> and click enter</li>
	<br>
    <img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/7.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:310px;border-radius:5px;">
<p><b>We can see our blank document “example_3”</b></p>
<p> </p>
<h5>8. Lets try example_3</h5>
	
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">cd example_3 </span> and click enter</li>
	
	<img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/8.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:310px;border-radius:5px;">

  <p> <span class="boldfont">It will not let us open this document, because it isn’t a directory/folder. It is a file.</span></p>

<h5>9. Now that we are more familiar with the path that we will be taking, let’s get there with one line of code.</h5>
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">cd</span> and click enter</li>
<p>This command takes us back to our home navigation screen.</p>

  
	
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">cd Desktop/example/example_2</span> and click enter</li>
	<li>Type: <span class="commandline">ls</span> and click enter</li>
   <br> 
	<img src="images_for_website/ScreenshotsFromPi/9.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="height:320px;border-radius:5px;">

<p> <span class="boldfont"> We are in the same location we were before.</span></p>

<p>  We will continue to use a command line interface throughout various parts of this project.</p>

<br>  <span class="boldtext">Linux:</span> Just like Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac OS X, Linux is an operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply – the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (often referred to as the “OS”), the software wouldn’t function. The biggest differentiator between Linux and other OS is that Linux set out to be open sourced, which means that users can access it for free.
<p> <span class="underline">Example:</span>  We will be using Raspberry Pi OS as our operating system, which is based off of the Linux platform. You can think of it was a modified version of Linux.

<br>  <span class="boldtext">Python:</span> An object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. More simply it’s a programming language that is easy for developers to read and translate. Python also supports the use of modules and packages, which means that you can create a program and use it in another project by importing it.
<p> <span class="underline">Example:</span> Python is used in projects such as the YouTube platform, programming NASA equipment, and Google’s search engine.
