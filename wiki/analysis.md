# Analysis Tutorial
If you have successfully followed the tutorials thus far, you should have a number of data files produced by your CHART. Now, what to do with them?
These data files contain your measurements of the Milky Way (or, another target, if you've chosen another science case!)-- however, these files are raw measurements that won't look like actual Milky Way spectra quite yet, as they have a number of effects imposed upon them by the enviornment and the telescope.
