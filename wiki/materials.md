Materials
=====

This list is intended to serve as a starting place for some suggested materials to build the baseline version of CHART.

## Materials for building the horn
- 4 36” x 48” Double walled cardboard sheets. Refrigerator boxes work well.
Check with your local appliance store.
- About 75 square feet of aluminum foil.
- Hot glue gun with hot glue. [For example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K791YRP).
- Tape.
- Aluminum foil tape. [For example](https://www.menards.com/main/paint/adhesives-glue-tape/tape/foil-tape/duck-reg-all-purpose-1-88-x-10-yd-aluminum-foil-tape/280416/p-1444442301284-c-7181.htm)

## Materials for the probe:
The links here are small kits because you won't find individual components on
stores like Amazon. If you have a local electronics/hobbyist store, you might
try there, but even the small kits are not too expensive.
- [Panel mount SMA connector with bulkhead solder cup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078H4F8R6).
- 1 small scrap aluminum (a soup can lid covered in aluminum tape works well).
- [1 SMA male-to-male right angle connector](https://www.amazon.com/BOOBRIE-Degree-Adapter-Connector-Contacts/dp/B07F9V9Q6V).
  - Alternatively, some of our builds include (male-to-female right angle connectors)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XHLQNWY] and (adaptors)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDHBS19] because that is what we had on hand.
- 6.3cm solid copper wire.

## Materials for the electronics chain
- (Nooelec filter and low-noise amplifier)[https://www.amazon.com/Nooelec-SAWbird-H1-Barebones-Applications/dp/B07XJLKQDN]
- (optional) (SMA style termination load)[https://www.amazon.com/DHT-Electronics-coaxial-connector-Termination/dp/B00BXUYDMM]
- (SMA cable)[https://www.amazon.com/Superbat-coaxial-Bulkhead-Adapter-Equipment/dp/B08B16PRT6] - Long enough to run from monitor to wherever you want to take data. Note: if you go with the RTL-SDR *kit* linked below, you do not need this cable.
- RTL-SDR. This can be purchased (stand-alone)[https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Defined/dp/B0CD745394] or as a (kit)[https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Defined/dp/B0CD7558GT] for more hacking. The kit comes with the SMA cable you need, but you will need a (male-to-male SMA adaptor)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDHBS19].

## Materials for the computer
- Raspberry Pi. We recommend the (RPi 400)[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17377] for convenience. This kit comes with a keyboard, mouse, power cable, HDMI cable, and SD card which otherwise would need to be purchased separately.
- (Micro SD card reader)[https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/969779658] for loading the software onto your RPi's SD card.
- (A portable computer monitor)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S74MP36]
- Ethernet cable (Optional, if not using WiFi option)
- (USB portable charger)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XFBN7HX] for powering the pi and monitor.

## Recommended extras
- Multimeter with continuity functionality
- Soldering kit
- Small radio antenna
