Materials
=====

This list is intended to serve as a starting place for some suggested materials to build the baseline version of CHART.

Purchase links were tested and costs estimated July, 2025.
Some links are small kits because you won't find individual components on stores like Amazon.
If you have a local electronics/hobbyist store, you might try there, but even the small kits are not too expensive.

The list below is meant to be exhaustive.
But you probably already own or have access to several pieces such as an ethernet cable, hot glue gun, boxcutter, etc.
Be sure to review your own set up and available resources before purchasing.
