Observing
===

If you've followed the telescope setup tutorial, you will now have a system that is ready to observe. The first step is to make a plan of where to point your CHART horn. You will need to know when the galaxy is visible in your location. Different parts of the Milky Way will be visible from different locations on Earth, depending on the time. The image below shows an artist's rendition of the Milky Way, as would be viewed from above. The galaxy is divided into units of "Galactic Longutude", with the center of the coordinate system at the sun. There are four Quadrants of Galactic longitude (I: 0 degrees to 90 degrees, II: 90 degrees to 180 degrees, III: 180 degrees to 270 degrees, IV: 270 degrees to 360 degrees). The II galactic quadrant is mostly only visible from the northern hemisphere, while the IV galactic quadrant is mostly only visible from the southern hemisphere. If you would like to make a rotation curve, only the I and IV quadrants are usable due to the geometry of the method we will use to calculate the rotation curve. This will be explained further in the analysis section.
