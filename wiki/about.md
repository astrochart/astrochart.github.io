Why We Created This Project
---------------------------

We believe in the importance of making astronomy accessible to anyone that is interested; that the ability to discover more about our home, the universe, is a right and not a luxury; and that creating collaborative projects with diversity as a priority allows for greater advances in the field of science. The convergence of these ideas come together in the CHART project. Accessibility in our project is defined as affordability and ease in navigation. The CHART project guides novices and hobbyist alike in building their own radio telescope and taking data directly from the skies above at a price around $100. We have chosen every material used in this project carefully to insure low cost to the user and ease in locating that part over time. We have created step-by-step tutorials to build an optimized telescope and set up its hardware, so that the participants feel guided in completion of the project, rather than intimidated and discouraged. All of our code for this project is open source so that anyone can access and modify it for their personal subprojects and collaborative endeavors. Our main mission for this project is to empower participants from anywhere in the world to gain experience in the field of astronomy and increase diversity and participation in STEM.

### Joan of Arc

Military leader and supporter of Charles VII of France

As a teenager, Joan developed a keeen interest in defending her French nation and
re-establishing the French monarch during the Hundred Years' War.
She rallied the rallied the troops at the siege of Orléans and continued pursuit of the
English armies ultimately leading to the end of the war.
Joan was canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920.

### Sara Jones

Project Enhancement

Sara is an undergraduate student at Arizona State studying astrophysics. After gathering her own CHART data, Sara worked on developing several memos regarding both her data and different methods of data collection. Currently, she is researching and developing potential new avenues for CHART.

### Carly Fitzgerald

Code Development

Carly is a student at Winona State studying physics. She is currently working on further developing the code in analysis to help it run smoother. She is also exploring how to measure the rotational curve of the outer galaxy. Carly’s future goals involve pursuing a career in engineering.

### Alexandra Nelander

Code Development and Hardware Testing

Continued the CHART project during spring and summer 2024. Created new rotation curve plots, tested the install process for the new disc image, and added a data collection memo. Currently working on default setting configurations and Bias-T instructions. Alexandra is an undergraduate student studying Physics and Astrophysics at Arizona State University. Her other projects include modeling radio emissions from high redshift black holes and AGN.
