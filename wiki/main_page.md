======
Radio astronomy is a fun and cheap way to observe the sky. Do it in the day time!

Build your own Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope!  For relatively little cost you can measure the rotation of
our galaxy and detect the effect of dark matter! 

Our goal with this project is to create an easy to navigate system of tutorials that will lead to you in building your
own radio telescope in your home or classroom and then observe with it. The horn is made of cardboard and the radio parts are
easy to find. The goal is to keep the total cost to under $200.




A quick introduction to the project.

# Get Started
First, follow [Telescope Construction](telescope_design.html) instructions to build the classic horn receiver out of
cardboard and a Raspberry Pi for a receiver.

Once you have your telescope, there are instructions for [Observing](observing.html) and then [Data
analysis](analysis.html)
